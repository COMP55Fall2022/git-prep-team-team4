About it I got a I got to, make do I'm just trying to get as much material as possible before I need to get going here, I'm really good at this hook as I say immediately as I miss you you're making fun of me up there ah berry berry the great white Gregory Greg Wayne Wayne Brady I'm gonna, call you Wayne Brady oh you didn't like that one oh no I'm gonna call you Wayne Brady all right. So Wayne Brady stalking me on the. Ocean there it is sorry about ceci throw link should nail just or missed you either what is that I want that whatever that is let me just get these because I'm. An opportunist okay don't miss this I didn't miss it he's planning boink hey that was pretty good.

Oh you make rope with oh oh okay so that's good that means that I can just set this, up and be able to just have that do that so what I'm gonna do is I'm.\r\n"
				+ "Gonna have a oh yeah I'm gonna get up I'm gonna get up Oh where's-where's playing break where's Wayne Brady alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna start building more, foundation cuz I mean heck yeah. Alright do you do do do do do do do Oh God okay alright oh god oh god oh man that is amazingly scary that is astonishingly scary treble hey back what back get, on my wrap ha I can build a free get, I can build a spear how do I build it what the , Wayne Brady you asshole what that back what the Wayne Brady jeez X Wayne what do you have, to say first I got a spirit of time I ain't gonna around when it comes to my raft don't . On me I'll on you right back don't Wayne Wayne I'm I will not hesitate to you up okay so my objective is eventually just. To make one of everything because that's what I want to.\r\n"
				+ "Do I should have made it more a lot of totally little italy– so that I could have crafted a cot more anyway empty trash empty tin can can be filled with saltwater that's, nice make more rope ah might as well grab this. Stuff that's floating right by Wayne don't do it what are you doing, win a water I need water oh god I didn't even think about that how do I get water water purifier this, I need this pure put salt water but this right here three put that there okay oh good, it's good ready okay then eight is some salt water fill fill okay and how do I put it how I use you three cook cook okay yay you're a fight faster faster, it seems dangerous I'm just gonna go ahead and say this it seems, really dangerous to just have this on a boat in the middle of the ocean I mean I know I'm desperate and all that but, yeah I should probably not do that this ready it pick up, drinkable water put more in there or eight drink yeah I did did I don't know all right win Brady don't don't on me don't on me don't stink on. Me please gonna take all day okay barrel.\r\n"
				+ "Barrel thank you okay got stuff and things and fatch don't even you up I will you up I will you up okay I, got a potato so I can cook something I think yeah I can I can definitely do that okay put that it put, that in there okay four. Okay that's good that's good that's good that's far I've got a potato so I can clip that pick up drinkable water if you drink that okay fill that cook that okay alright more yes yes. Yes this milk didn't get that oh but the boom oh in fact that in fact well I didn't, need to throw it all, it's really just kind of like a hobby of mine to throw things into the ocean to random you know I know it's not important but you know I just feel like it's good exercise for, me and Wayne Brady out here did, I get that potato I did it's right here okay that's good potato I think okay alright dipping this.\r\n"
				+ "It's a never-ending stream of supplies but I'll move them sorry the Beeman's tried to get out of my, body but there is oddly enough a really interesting system of doing it like you have an ever-present threat it really simplifies the survival experience in a. Really interesting way not in a good way that I like but you know interesting, one doodlee do I already have 10 cans I don't need more of those Oh perfect. Glug glug okay glug glug I seem to have a good system here I'd like another one of these so I'm going to do that but now I'm gonna. Get another one of these to put that right I'm gonna get to like a station going point okay then put you in there cook you up cook, you up cook you up, do you think you can get away from me you think you can get away from the markiplier no I hate the ocean and so should you will could. Get you if you did you yes oh don't even think about it I'll you up I'll you up. I'll you up I'll yeah Wayne Brady, huh yeah get the out of your Wayne there better not be more of you as time goes on I have a funny feeling there's gonna be more of you as time. Goes on drinkable water yeah that's what I'd like to see you put that in three-drug glug glug okay, then this over here Phil Phil damn it so much okay I'm just, gonna put the scrap wood wood spear over here this here cook these up boink boink cook my potato cook that up that's. Good I don't know where I'm in and all these. Potatoes from but oh the barrels ahh Wayne Brady don't kill me go can you do you lose I know they're coming right for me. I just feel like it so now that I'm not panicking let's actually take a look at this cropland.\r\n"
				+ "I should have a crop lit to try to make some sort of potato farm like that would make the most sense to me when we put this like try to maximize, space here it doesn't look good I guess I shouldn't do that because eventually I'm just gonna build. Out so put that bear we try, to plant a potato okay alright okay Oh drink drink Phil Phil cook cook okay ooh double barrel oh like a double-barrel. Shotgun of love yes thank you thank you thank you hey ha nailed it in – skrappe – okay that's good I got, a palm seed well that's interesting I don't know how I'm gonna be able to get a policy doubt it happen okay oh you win Brady so what I, need Oh a tree cropland. Okay that's good a chaste tree crop 'let a fishing pole that'd be good that's what I need I need one of those get the Rope going more rope I'm doing great there anything, else I can build ah oh, that's awesome oh there's awesome okay so whoo it doesn't make a lot of sense in terms of selecting oh my god okay you, know what I'm just gonna make some more pillars out this way okay so now that I'm wider which is probably what I needed in the first place, don't Wayne Wayne whoa I thought I saw the tail of something big in the distance and I, did not like what I saw oh boy okay so I don't know how harvest to potatoes okay. All right plant one cook one plant. Yeah wait how many potatoes do they have probably a lot apparently okay so stop it stop it okay more potatoes that's good I can. Just put this in here oh it's full oh well I guess I can cook it then I got drinkable water that's nice okay, so I I think I've got generally a system going on here and it's not too bad like I gotta admit this is going, pretty smoothly I mean so long as. There aren't more sharks appearing I gotta get the whole cast of whose line is it anyway up in my grill but so long as that doesn't happen action I should be generally okay well, Wayne Brady beeline uh serve I don't do it Wayne, Wayne Wayne think about what you're doing okay all right that's good good thing you thought about that no way no I see what you're doing no Wayne Wayne no no no means no stranger, danger do I need to repair that or something that cool oh I want. That I don't know I'm gonna do with that but I want it I want to build not other floors.\r\n"
				+ "Bull that Wayne where's that someone else to burn now okay I'm gonna try to fish oh I love fishing fishing school doesn't know. When nope hey I got a fish I can of raw mackerel whoo hey don't look at me like oh, don't look at me like that oh you went on there real quick okay well I, mean I'm doing oddly good for myself maybe I could just use this as like a platform to dive headfirst, into the mouth of the shark I got these do boo boo boo boo boo, boo man I'm gonna need more cookers that's what I'm gonna need I need I. Need to put them in a better place any way I can put them on her here that might be nice no not that seven there we. Go good eight oh I can't put, another all that's stupid I could fit it right here though Rudy right there that'll be good that's good I put my potatoes there oh missing a lot of, doodlee do okay oh oh mackerel contains a lot of protein. Hell yeah okay so I'm gonna eat this up oh that's nice plant these seeds we should come back here Dee Quebec Quebec oh don't come back there's been, a lot less supplies than I was hoping there would be and they seem to all. Be drifting over that way now so maybe I built too far over in one, direction it's kind of limiting the flow but then again that could be a good thing because there was there. Was another material that it could have built it was like um there's this net thing used to catch items floating by so how, does this work oh oh that's really cool okay so then you can just walk over here I could build out completely this way and. Then I would catch everything that I need but I don't have enough already I need, more I need to make more rope okay I've got a lot more nets now so I'm gonna poop that loop this loop that's a nice Boop, oh man that's it that's a sweet Boop uh-huh nice net all right now now Wayne do not up my. Goddamn net I swear. Also I swear that as soon as I put those nets over there and start putting all the other things on. The wrong side now my fault they just did it that way all right so I need the drinkable water I need to put the rope where I need to grab the. Batch I need to grab, all the goodies the scrap I don't understand i Meadows floating but I'm not gonna question reality when I'm desperate drink the water need to put fill the cast need a firm cook gun oh yeah I'm gone. I'm net yes yes yes my sweet net. Hell yeah oh that's awesome that works great that worked wonderfully weird sweet catch bruh okay so now that I'm doing relatively alright I want to get more. Nets out there but I'm just gonna hold off for now I'm going to build now I'm an old off so, now that I've got enough supplies I think I'm actually going to. Start building Wayne's being a bit of a bitch that's okay I'll forgive him okay so I'm gonna build up I'm, gonna build up I don't even why I guess I didn't go. Foundation over here but I'm gonna kind of build like a hey did that bother you Wayne huh no no ha ha Jesus, Christ that ass alright so now that I got what I needed I'm gonna build the second floor because I'm very ambitious like that so I want to build, I guess I'll need a pillar kind of a pillar right I mean I'll need a pillar duh yeah I think oh yeah pretty sure that. I need a floor ah well, that's interesting but I don't know what the benefit of having this is all right this is my perch it's my lonliness perch it's where I go to shout. How lonely I am at times just had to stop and get this before I declare my loneliness in the world are everybody. Ready ah that's a good horizon to look upon I'm lonely I have no friends I have no wife my kids. Are good the good good man lonely hey Wayne Brady all my friends that, I had hate me I got fired from my job I've never put money in my pension plan I hate George okay all. Right thanks thanks Wayne thanks for listening to my loneliness I'm glad that I got assembled I'd and wallows be incredibly lonely did you know, it's a good change of pace all right so what else can I make what else can I. Make a tree crop late– I. Could put that up on my lonliness perch well that does not fit on my lonliness perch well that seems off that seems that seems too big. But oh well you know what Marga bar is not efficient that's for damn sure if it fits I like it so I'm gonna build a palm tree. Barely okay. She's gotta wait a couple hours for that to finish you up good drink but drinkable water to be good have golf at drinkable water good water drinkable it's good drinkable and. Stuff all right back up on line loneliness birch let's see Oh what. What what direction have I not declared by loneliness I don't think I've done it this way yet hmm okay all right then I'm incapable of feeling love I don't even, have a beat Wayne the .\r\n"
				+ "Was that whoo I didn't like that I don't even have a beach ball to be my friend I don't even have tiny box Tim to be my, friend oh thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you oh it's tiny I don't think that's how those things grow I. Also don't think, that I could see them grow right before my eyes well that's bizarre that is just the weirdest I don't know where I got all this dirt from uh Who am I to complain about free dirt okay build, more the morning Fat Boys over here.\r\n"
				+ "Yeah what do you figure out Wayne huh right Hansel good maybe if. I build some walls it might funnel my loneliness ooh where did I get the cloth oh whatever can I build another one can, I build one more of those bad boys up here please really please please fine hey in Wayne .\r\n"
				+ "Duane god damn it Wayne oh oh oh I kill all I killed Wayne I don't think. I was supposed to kill Wayne oh I don't I don't think anything likes me killing Wayne whoo something tells me that might have been a bad idea whoo, I shouldn't killed Wayne oh no now that I think about a Wayne might have been my only friend in this horrible survival circumstance my, only friend is trying to kill me how appropriate oh well whatever wheezes hello get, me out of the okay all right then so anyway I think that's about the long and the short of the. Game I don't know what the end goal is just other than survival no much else to do so, I'm gonna I'm gonna taught this guy you, know what I'm so lonely maybe I'm just gonna hug it out with the bro oh whoa hey put. An anti climactic end well anyway so that was raft this game is available on it co and it's not bad there's some potential here it's a bit too simplified though I think it needs more elements to it but. I like the concept the concept is interesting so long as you can make the, threat kind of incrementally get better I feel like there needs, to be a weather system that needs to be like Crysis is there need to be like you know other stuff, more dangerous more sharks and all that stuff but either way it's pretty cool so thank you everybody so. Much for watching let me know what you thought of it down the comments below as always I will see you in the next video bye ", 200, 400);
